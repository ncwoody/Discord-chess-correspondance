# Discord-chess-correspondance
A Discord bot which will allow you to play chess correspondance with you friends
Written in Python
This will track your moves, and auto detect when there is a check, or the game is over
Will also print out the board so you can visualize it better
Also can make a move for you! (may not be a good move though)
Relies on the python chess library, found at https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess
Still in developement, so expect updates where I'll make it work better (may not be frequent)

If you want to use it, make sure to enter in the token for your bot at the bottom on the code
